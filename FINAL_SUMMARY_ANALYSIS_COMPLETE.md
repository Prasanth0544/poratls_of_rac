## 🚀 THE 3 CRITICAL TASKS

### Task #1: Complete Authentication (30 minutes)
```
File:       backend/server.js
What:       Add 5-10 lines to register routes
Why:        Routes exist but not integrated
Impact:     Unblocks all dependent work
Difficulty: TRIVIAL
When:       Start immediately
Result:     All 3 login endpoints working
```

### Task #2: Refactor ReallocationService (6-8 hours)
```
File:       backend/services/ReallocationService.js
Current:    931 lines in single file
Goal:       Split into 6 modular services
Services:   NoShow, Boarding, Upgrade, Vacancy, Eligibility, Constants
Why:        Code quality, maintainability, testability
Impact:     70% reduction in file complexity
Difficulty: MEDIUM
When:       After Task #1
Result:     Modular, testable codebase
```

### Task #3: API Documentation (4-6 hours)
```
File:       Create backend/swagger.js + JSDoc comments
Current:    Only informal markdown files
Goal:       Full Swagger UI with interactive endpoints
Why:        Frontend developers need clear API contract
Impact:     Better developer experience, fewer questions
Difficulty: MEDIUM
When:       After Task #2
Result:     /api-docs with complete documentation
```

**Critical Path Total: 11-15 hours**

Result: 37-42% completion, high code quality
```

### Phase 2: Supporting Tasks (9-13 hours)
```
Day 4-5: Tasks #4-8 (Validation, Error handling, etc.)
Result: 56-62% completion, enterprise-ready
```

### Phase 3: Testing (24+ hours) - OPTIONAL
```
Week 2: Unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests
